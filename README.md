# Inversity Team 11 Hackathon project

In this project we want to demonstrate that incorporating data from more than one turbine can improve the performance of a machine learning model that predicts faulty turbine behaviour.

# Dataset:
We start from downloading a real dataset from Kaggle, that contains 4 time series related to a turbine, specifically
